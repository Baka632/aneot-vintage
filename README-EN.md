## Notice for static web site

If you want to generate static files, add command line argument ```-- static-only```

By default, static web site will be generated in `src/AnEoT.Vintage/StaticWebSite` folder

If you want to change it, use the following method to do that (ordered by the priority)
- Use *command line argument*:
```dotnet run --StaticWebSiteOutputPath "YOUR PATH" -- static-only```
- Set *environment variables* named ```StaticWebSiteOutputPath```: set it in ```launchSettings.json``` or in your command line interface

- Add ```StaticWebSiteOutputPath``` in *appsettings.json*
```
{
   ......
   "StaticWebSiteOutputPath": "YOUR PATH"
   ......
}
```

## About WebP image support for vintage devices...

Most vintage devices don't support WebP image, so WebP image can't be displayed on these devices.

To solve this problem, we enabled the feature that converts WebP image to JPEG image.

If you want to disable it, use the following method to do that (ordered by the priority)
- Use *command line argument*:
```dotnet run --ConvertWebP false```
- Set *environment variables* named ```ConvertWebP```: set it in ```launchSettings.json``` or in your command line interface.
- Add ```ConvertWebP``` in *appsettings.json*.
```
{
   ......
   "ConvertWebP": false
   ......
}
```

This configuration will affect static web site generation.
